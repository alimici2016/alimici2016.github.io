      <h5>Customer Service</h5>
      <h6>May 2014 | July 2015</h6>
  
    <ul>
      <li>This was one of my first jobs and it was for me the first time I experinced a set of responsiblities that included operating an entire store as well maintaining quality of work for the customers.</li>
      <li>I made the coffee every morning, cleaned the gas station, maintained the register, stocked the inventory, and threw out all the garbage.</li>
      <li>Finally I was able to, for the most part, make both the customers and managers proud because even though it was not the most sought out job I made sure I did everything with excellence to the best of my capablities. Through this display of hardwork I was able to gain the trust of my mangers and I was able to be shift leader.</li>
